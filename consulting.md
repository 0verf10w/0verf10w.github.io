<p>I love working with small-to-medium sized businesses to help you make sense of your data, and automate away your analytics reporting issues. Here's examples of questions I've helped clients with:</p>

<table class="services">

	<tr>
	<td>
	<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>Do you have Google Analytics enabled on your site, but just haven't had the time to take a deep dive into it? I can help you walk through the various reports, and drill down into possible opportunities.</p>
	</td>

	<td>
	<h3>Marketing Metrics</h3>
    <p>There are so many platforms to market your products, and with each new site, you run into the problem of evaluating how efficient your campaign was, and how it compared to your other marketing initiatives. I can work with your accounts in Amazon Seller Central, Google Ad Words, Facebook, Youtube, Constant Contact and other similar sites to help you understand how your marketing campaigns stack up against each other.</p>
	</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>
	<h3>Shipping Optimization</h3>
    <p>Where do you ship most often? Which carriers/services do you use and how much does it cost you? Are you charging your international customers enough to cover your shipping costs? I can help you make sense of your shipping data from ShipStation, Stamps.com and similar websites, and answer specific questions you have about your shipping.</p>
	</td>
	
	<td>
	<h3>Data Reporting</h3>
    <p>Do you already know the exact reports you like to see regularly, but have difficulty creating the reports every month? I can work with you to create Excel or Google Sheets-based reporting that will automate and simplify the process your team has to do to get you the reports.</p>
	</td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p>Have a different kind of data problem? Write me a note and I'd be happy to work with you on possible solutions.</p>
