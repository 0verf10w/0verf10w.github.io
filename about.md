<p>I'm a data and FP&A analyst, and Founder/CEO of a data analytics consultancy called 3PM Coffee Break. I've lived all over Southern California in the last 15 years now, loved every minute of it and currently make my home in the greater San Diego area, with my husband.</p>

<p>I grew up in India, in a metropolitan town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara" target="_blank">Baroda</a>. Baroda is best known for its beautiful <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Baroda_Lvp.JPG" target="_blank">royal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Vilas_Palace,_Vadodara" target="_blank">palace</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_Sayajirao_University_of_Baroda" target="_blank">awesome university</a> and a small-city feel with big city values. We also have the best <a href="https://youtu.be/ooEfsNeCfdw?t=4m3s" target="_blank">garba</a> in Gujarat.</p>

<p>I did grad school at <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. I enjoyed the snow a lot, though that was probably because I never had to shovel any of it.</p>

<p>These days, I'm working on a number of projects, including data analytics consulting for small businesses. It's very satisfying to work with business owners who are passionate about what they make and sell, and it's a pleasure to play a part in helping their cause.</p>
