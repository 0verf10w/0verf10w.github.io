<p>I love analyzing data, managing process improvement projects and learning new things. I'm also Founder/CEO of a data analytics consultancy called 3PM Coffee Break. I've lived all over Southern California in the last 15 years now, loved every minute of it and currently make my home in the greater San Diego area, with my husband.</p>

<p>I grew up in India, in a metropolitan town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara" target="_blank">Baroda</a>. Baroda is best known for its beautiful <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Baroda_Lvp.JPG" target="_blank">royal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Vilas_Palace,_Vadodara" target="_blank">palace</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_Sayajirao_University_of_Baroda" target="_blank">awesome university</a> and a small-city feel with big city values.</p>

<p>I moved here in my senior year of high school, and have made my home in Southern California since. Except for an incredibly fulfilling year in grad school at <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>

<p>These days, I'm consulting with Warner Bros. as a hybrid project manager / business analyst on a SharePoint 2013 implementation project, where I've had the opportunity to flex muscles in project and people management, Nintex workflow development, PowerBI reporting, thinking about UX/design for user guides and training materials, possibilities of recording tutorial videos (perhaps launching a budding career as a voiceover artist (not.) and the incredible privilege of assisting folks in solving daily work problems.</p>
