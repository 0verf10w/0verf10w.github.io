<p> I work on two different projects which both come under the broad umbrella of experimental nuclear physics. One of it is a hardware project in which I am helping to design and build a detector subsystem and in the other I analyse the collision data from 2016 at Brookhaven national lab. Brief explanation of these projects are given below:

<p> Building of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) :

Time projection chamber is a tracking device used in many physics experiments to be able to track energetic particles as they move through a medium. I help in building a tracking device for upcoming detector system sPHENIX at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). 
Unlike most TPCâ€™s, which have a spatial resolution of 300 microns, we are hoping to achieve a resolution of 150 microns which will be a critical in measuring fully resolved upsilon states and thus the debye radius of quark gluon plasma. The tracking system will work in continuous read out, at high data collection rates -15kHz- and will be able to provide momentum resolution.
